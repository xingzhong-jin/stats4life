      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;my-name-is-xingzhong-jason-jin-and-im-a-data-scientist-specializing-in-clinical-trials&#34;&gt;My name is &lt;strong&gt;Xingzhong (Jason) Jin&lt;/strong&gt; and I&amp;rsquo;m a &lt;strong&gt;Data Scientist&lt;/strong&gt; specializing in &lt;strong&gt;Clinical Trials&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am a former clinician turned epidemiologist and health data scientist. I completed my medical degree in 2006, and finished a PhD in clinical epidemiology in 2016. During PhD, I developed a passion for statistics and clinical trials. Post-PhD, I worked at three research centers overseeing a number of clinical trials. It was when I got particularly interested in applying data science to clinical trials. Now, I am a Research Fellow at the Centre for Big Data Research in Health, University of New South Wales.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My academic research interests include early prevention of osteoarthritis and optimize patient selection for joint replacement. These days I spend a lot of my time coding in R and conducting innovative research studies with real-world health data. When I am not coding, I like bush-walking, playing basketball and reading books (self-development and investment).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I live in Sydney, Australia, with my wife, my beautiful kid, a Chihuahua and a Russian Blue cat.&lt;/p&gt;
