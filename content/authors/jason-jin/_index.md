## My name is **Xingzhong (Jason) Jin** and I'm a **Healthcare Data Scientist** specialising in **Clinical Research**

I am a former clinician turned epidemiologist and health data scientist. 

I completed my medical degree in 2006, and finished a PhD in clinical epidemiology in 2016. During PhD, I developed a passion for statistics and clinical trials. Post-PhD, I worked at multiple research centers overseeing a number of clinical trials. It was when I got particularly interested in applying data science to clinical trials. 

Now, I am a Research Fellow at the Centre for Big Data Research in Health, University of New South Wales. My academic research interests include early prevention of osteoarthritis and optimize patient selection for joint replacement. 

These days I spend a lot of my time coding in R and conducting innovative research with real-world health data. When I am not coding, I like bush-walking, playing basketball and reading books (self-development and investment).  

I live in Sydney, Australia, with my wife, my beautiful kid, a Chihuahua and a Russian Blue cat.
